### 🙋‍♀️ A short introduction
Shi zhiwen is a 22-years old boy borning in Shangqiu, Henan province and growing up in Hangzhou, Zhejiang province in China.
I study Material Science and Engineering in Wuhan University of Technology for 4 years and will get the balchelor's degree in July, 2022.
I have approached github and open-source for nearly 2 years. I hope I can finish the GTB practices from May 16,2022. 
In my free time, I enjoy going to walk and the outside.
